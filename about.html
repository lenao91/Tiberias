		<h1><u>Little bit about me</u></h1>
		<p>My name is <span class="lena">Lena Osadchy</span>, i'm 29 years old and i living in Tiberias the most beautiful city in the world!<br>
			I like to travel and see new views and people, this is my way to relax and feel good.<br>
			Nature is my love, and every morning i wake up with the sunrise, and go to the Sea of Galilee, starting my day with swimming.<br>
			I also like to finnish up my day by wallking in the forest near by my home,<br>
			called <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A5" target="_blank">Switzerland Forest</a>, watching on the cows and horses, and meet strangers with the same hobbie like me.
